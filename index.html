<h1>Code Club </h1>

<h2>3D projects </h2>>

<p>First, make the 3D coder keyring  project from the <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software[]=blockscad">code club site.</a></p>

<p>Next you can make you own design of key ring, which we will 3D print. You might like to make one with your name, or you may have another idea - it's up to you. You could make: </p>

<ul>
<li>A key ring with just letters like the example. </li>
<li>A key ring with raised letters. </li>
<li>A key ring with cut out letters. </li>
</ul>

<p>The best design will depend on the letters in your design and the font you choose. </p>

<p>Your key ring will be printed on a 3D printer.</p>

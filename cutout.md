# Cut Out Letter Keyring

To make the cut out letter keyring, start with the letters as in the example 'CODER' project, but this time, leave space between them.

First make the base using a cube. The Z size is the height, set this to 3. Adjust the X and Y so that is is about the same size as your word.

To cut out the letters, join them all together using a 'union' from the 'Set Ops' menu. Then take this away from the base using a 'difference' blck which is also in the 'Set Ops' menu.

You will need to make a hole to attach the key chain. The hole is a small cylinder. Add this in to the union with the letters so it is also cut out from the base.
